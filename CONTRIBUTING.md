<h1>CONTRIBUTING</h1>

This page is about <b>contributing</b>.

<br>

This Markdown file covers issues, pull requests, and discussions!

<br>

It is now time to talk about contributing!

<h2>Issues</h2>

Reporting issues, bugs, security vulnerabilities, and requesting features under the <a href="https://www.github.com/EggOfGlory999/Free-Daily-Chess-Puzzles/Issues">issues page</a> are all one way to contribute!

<br>

Here is how to report an issue...

<br>

<br>

<h3>Reporting an issue</h3>

Step One: Log in to github, or if you do not have an account, sign up to github <a href="https://www.github.com/join">here.</a>

<br>

(If you are already signed in to github, you do not have to follow step one)

<br>

<br>

Step 2: Click on 'issues'

<br>

Step 3: Click on 'new issue'

<br>

Step 4a: For a bug report, go to 'Bug report' and click on the 'Get Started' button, then give details of the bug, and send screenshots, and/or a video for proof of the existense of the bug.

<br>

Step 4b. For a feature request, go to 'Feature Request' and click on the 'Get Started' button, then give details of what your new idea of what the new feature should be, and add screenshots, and/or a video for context.

<br>

Step 4c. For a security vulnerability, go to 'Security Vulnerability' and click on the 'View Policy' button, and follow the instructions.

<br>

Step 4d. For another type of issue, click 'Open a blank issue' and give a description and title of the issue, and send screenshots and/or a video for proof.

<h2>Issues [CONTINUED]</h2>

You may not send false issues; that is called lying, and could get you a warning, then for 3 violations, a temporary ban.

(Learn more about lying <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie">here.</a>)

<br>

You may also not copy any issue and sell it as your own; that is plagarism, and could get you temporarily banned. 

(Learn more abour plagarism <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism">here.</a>)

<br>

You also may not send an issue without screenshots and/or a video, because that could result in lying.
If you are telling the truth, but do not send screenshots and/or a video, you will only be corrected.
If you are lying, and forget to send screenshots and/or a video, that is an immediate temporary ban.

Read the section about fraudulent security vulnerability for more information.

<br>

You may NEVER send a fraudulent security vulnerability.
If you send a fraudulent security vulnerability with screenshots and/or a video, then you will be temporarily banned.
If you send a fraudulent security vulnerability with no screenshots nor a video, then you will be permanently bannned.

<br>

And that was it for issues!
It is now time to talk about pull requests.

<h2>Pull Requests</h2>

Pull requests most commonly come when you create a new branch, although you can create them yourself.

Pull requests are requests for merging 2 branches together. Once a branch has been merged, it can be deleted.

<h3>How to create your own pull requests</h3>

<h4>Note that you can only do this if there are at least 2 branches, and the 'non-master' branch is at least one commitment behind the master branch.</h4>

Step 1: Click on 'Pull Requests'

Step 2: Click on 'New Pull Request'

Step 3: Change the base and 'compare' around until you can successfully make a pull request.

Step 4: Create the pull request.

Step 5: Wait for a collaborator or the owner to merge the 2 branches together.

Now a pull request has been closed!

<h2>Pull Requests [CONTINUED]</h2>

The pull request may never be a fake pull request.

If the pull request is just to delete a branch, then you must specify that you want a pull request only to delete a branch and/or fork.

Well, that was a lot of explaining about pull requests.
It is now time to finally talk about discussions.

<h2>Discussions</h2>

Discussions can be used for a Q&A, announcements, or really, just for socializing!

Discussions can be closed, or opened. You can also give out ideas, do a show and tell, and more.

<h3>How to make a discussion</h3>

Step 1: Click on 'discussions'

Step 2: Click on 'New Discussion'

Step 3: Select a category

Step 4: Add a title and a description.

Step 5: Create the discussion.

<h2>Discussions [CONTINUED]</h2>

Please be kind when using the discussions, and commenting.

When puting in images, please do not put in sexual images.

Please do not use discussions for dating. Online Dating can and will result in a temporary ban. 3 violations and that is a permanent ban.

Discussions may be used for advertising, but please do not spam advertisements.

<br>

Well, there are so many ways to contribute, and socialize!

I hope you can have a great time in here!

Remember, keep on solving chess puzzles, and have a great day!
