# freedailychesspuzzles
Welcome to Free Daily Chess Puzzles!
No accounts are needed to do these daily puzzles!
This is where you can see the magic behind this whole project.
Every day, a new generated daily chess puzzle will be featured on the face of the site.
Any chess puzzle off the face of the site will be archived in a separate page.
You can request for me to recreate an idea for a chess puzzle, so long as the solution is given. 
Email me your chess puzzle ideas at jackson.newman999@gmail.com.

This is version 1.0.1!
