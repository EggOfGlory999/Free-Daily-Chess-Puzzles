<h2>Reporting a Vulnerability</h2>

If by any chance, you see a vulnerability...

<br>

...email me <a href="mailto:jackson.newman999@gmail.com">here...</a>

<br>

...and the problem will be founded and resolved!

<h2>Instructions</h2>

If you find a security vulnerability...

<br>

Step 1: Find the vulnerability.

<br>

Step 2: Take screenshots and/or record a video of the vulnerability.

<br>

Step 3: Email the issue <a href="mailto:jackson.newman999@gmail.com">here.</a>

<br>

Step 4: Give details of the vulnerability.

<br>

Step 5: Send the screenshots and/or video for proof so I can validate the vulnerability.

<br>

Step 6: Wait for an email saying that it either is proven to be real, or that it is not real.

<br>

If the vulnerability gets detected, and is proven real, then the vlnerability should be covered.

<br>

If I say otherwise, then you will get a correction.

<br>

<h2>Vulnerbility Reporting Expectations</h2>

To make sure you are NOT lying to me, you must send a video...
<br>
...or screenshots.
<br>
The code will be searched across, and if it is to not be seen anywhere...
<br>
...then I know it is fake, but if it is to be founded...
<br>
...then I know it is real, and the vulnerability will be covered!
