<h2>Reporting a Vulnerability</h2>

If by any chance, you see a vulnerability...
<br>
...email me <a href="mailto:jackson.newman999@gmail.com">here...</a>
<br>
...and the problem will be founded and resolved!

<h2>Vulnerbility Reporting Expectations</h2>

To make sure you are NOT lying to me, you must send a video...
<br>
...or screenshots.
<br>
The code will be searched across, and if it is to not be seen anywhere...
<br>
...then I know it is fake, but if it is to be founded...
<br>
...then I know it is real, and the vulnerability will be covered!
